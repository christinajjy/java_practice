Bdemo

class file executed
context created
static members downloaded into context
static blocks are executed
main is searched
new operator is encountered
creates obj-loads all non static elements of class
initialises uninitialised var
searches non static blocks(executes them)
constructor is loaded
executed- removed from memory
(if no obj is created,non static blocks won't be executed)

static blocks are used to give information abt program since it is executed onces context is loaded- ie after class file is loaded
non static blocks are used to repeat the common code of constructor
