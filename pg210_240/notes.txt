execptions

obj created by jvm that rep logical errors
    syntax errors, improper environment--compilation errors
logical-jvm can't detect

Exception class
    classes under this
    obj of these are created by jvm when logical error is encountered
    if this obj is not handled, returns to jvm(has functions to enable this) and the program ends
    if handled program doesn't terminate
    obj can be assigned to corresponding exception class ref

once exception is encountered rest of try block won't be executed

simple logical errors- div by 0- Exception class
serious logical errors- creation of obj when ram is full-Error class

Object class
    Throwable class
        Exception class
        Error class

try block can only transfer obj of Throwable class and its subclasses
catch can only recieve obj of Throwable class and its subclasses

serious errors are supposed to be handled by jvm internally
handling serious errors will prevent them from reaching jvm,which means we are neglecting serious logical errors-- dangerous
never use Throwable referenced obj in catch-- i.e handling both Error and Exception objects
only use Exception referenced and its subclass referenced objects

compiler compells us to handle-checked exception(IOException,ClassNotFoundException) - else- unchecked Exception(ArithmeticException etc)

subclass of RuntimeException --unchecked exception
not a subclass of RE- checked

throws is a keyword used to inform the end user that a particular function is proven to transfer exception class obj to its calling place
