all variables in an interface are public static and final
methods in an interface can not be static
static constants must be initialised as default initialisation is not provided

interface Xyz
A implements Xyz
B extends A 
=> obj of B can be assigned to interface Xyz reference

interface reference can be typecast into its equivalent reference of a class
similarly can be typecast into equivalent reference of another interface
