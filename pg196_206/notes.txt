inner class

non static member inner class should not have static members

objects of inner class can be created from its outer class as well as from some other class which is outside the outer class

private inner class--object creatable only in outer class

inner class can extend any class available to outer class

redundant for inner class to extend outer class

static inner class---
    any access specifier
    can have static as well as non static members
    static member- directly available to non static/static members
    non static not available to static members
    non static members are static cuz in static domain
    can not access non static members of outer class

doubt pg 200 program is giving error -- Test.java

local inner class -- inside a function
    local var of the function are not accessible(not true tho according to compilation,got error only for not initialising it)(pg 202)
    is equivalent to a local var hence all rules apply - no access specifiers
    local constants are accessible-- final
    can not create boj of local inner class inside main of outer class, only inside the function it is defined in

Anon inner class    
    defined without a name
    need an interface or abstract class
    two types:
        local Anon
        member Anon
    class Test1.java(pg 203)
    class Test2.java(pg 204)
    class Test3.java(pg 205)
